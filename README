StyleTool: A simple, open source, word frequency based stylometry tool

This program does a word frequency comparison to perform stylometry on text
documents. There is a simple GUI made with tk. It can do principle component
analysis (PCA) and plot the results so that clustering can be performed
visually (using the squint algorithm). Word frequency data and PCA results can
also be saved. The program requires GNU plotutils and Ruby/GSL.
